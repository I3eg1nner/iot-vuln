## Description:

The ProRouter H685 router is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability that can be exploited using a hard-coded guest account. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass normal access controls and traverse the file system to access files and directories outside the web root directory.

- Hard-Coded Guest Account: The router contains a hard-coded guest account with known credentials (e.g., guest:guest). This account can be used to log into the web interface without requiring any additional authorization.
- Session Acquisition: Once logged in with the guest account, an attacker can obtain a valid session. This session can then be used to construct HTTP requests that exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.
